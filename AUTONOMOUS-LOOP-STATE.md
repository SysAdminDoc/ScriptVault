# Autonomous Loop State

Project: ScriptVault
Assigned path: `\\vmware-host\Shared Folders\repos\ScriptVault`
Last cycle: Cycle 35 - 2026-06-06

## Latest Result

- Cycle 21 shipped the P1 source-aligned coverage gate and pushed commit
  `1772b6a`.
- Cycle 22 added weekly Dependabot version updates for npm and GitHub Actions,
  with grouped minor/patch tooling updates and separate major update PRs.
- Cycle 23 aligned the Node/npm toolchain contract on Node 24.16.0+ and npm
  11.13.0+, with engine-strict local installs, setup-node version-file usage,
  CWS/toolchain gates, and docs.
- Cycle 24 pinned all GitHub Actions workflow refs to full SHAs with same-line
  version comments and added `npm run actions:pins:check`.
- Cycle 25 added the optional dependency reach gate so the
  `npm audit --omit=optional` policy is backed by a shipped-source import scan.
- Cycle 26 added a settings schema classification gate covering defaults,
  TypeScript keys, and dashboard save handlers.
- Cycle 27 added targeted Settings field validation for badge color, lint max
  size, WebDAV/S3 endpoint URLs, denied hosts, and linter JSON.
- Cycle 28 added schema metadata for all classified visible settings plus
  dashboard-saved credential controls.
- Cycle 29 added accessible validation for Settings pattern-list text areas:
  whitelisted pages, blacklisted pages, manual blacklist, and download
  whitelist.
- Cycle 30 made settings metadata an active dashboard contract by checking
  metadata element IDs against dashboard control types, select options, and
  validation error-node wiring.
- Cycle 31 closed the Settings discoverability/validation roadmap row after an
  acceptance recheck.
- Cycle 32 shipped GM namespace alias parity and documented the `GM.fetch`
  deferral until the guarded network contract is implemented.
- Cycle 33 added GM value-change remote regression coverage for storage
  fan-out and wrapper callback semantics, plus a Playwright two-tab spec that
  records the unattended Chromium `allow-user-scripts-disabled` gate instead
  of hanging.
- Cycle 34 closed the CWS API v2 migration row by pinning v2 upload, publish,
  fetchStatus, and rollout endpoint contracts in `npm run cws:check`, adding
  optional `CWS_DEPLOY_PERCENTAGE` publish rollout control, and documenting
  service-account/OIDC as the target with OAuth as the local fallback.
- Cycle 35 closed the Monaco ESM migration planning row with
  `docs/monaco-esm-migration-plan.md`, pinning the current AMD/sandbox state,
  a local bundled ESM target, CSP constraints, Firefox AMO fallback rules, and
  validation gates for the later implementation pass.
- Verification used the live checkout: focused Monaco plan tests,
  `npm run check`, and `npm run build`.

## Next Cycle Focus

Continue top-down from `ROADMAP.md`. The live two-tab
`GM_addValueChangeListener` smoke remains browser-profile gated until
`chrome.userScripts` is enabled for the unpacked extension, and the AMO
submission row is blocked on maintainer credentials. The next local
implementer-actionable work is X-1, the dedicated Edge browser smoke before
elevating support.

## Loop Pointer
